# Welcome to the Global Center for Digital Influence Research (GCDIR)

The Global Center for Digital Influence Research (GCDIR) is an independent,
intra-disciplinary research organization focused on understanding how digital
influence shapes human behavior. With roots in both industry and academia, but
without ties to any single institution, GCDIR bridges sectors to advance rigorous
research. We connect real-world data with academic expertise across economics,
political science, statistics, computer science, psychology, and marketing.

## Our Mission

We conduct rigorous research to understand digital influence and how it shapes
public opinion, political discourse, and social behavior. Our work helps
policymakers, researchers, industry, and the public gain deeper insight into the
mechanisms and impacts of influence in the digital age.

## What We Do

- **Research**: Conduct in-depth studies on the mechanisms of digital influence.
- **Analysis**: Generate data-driven insights into online information ecosystems.
- **Education**: Share findings through publications, talks, and public engagement.
- **Collaboration**: Partner with academia and industry to advance knowledge and practice.
